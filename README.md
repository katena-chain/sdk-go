# SDK Go

## Requirements

- Go >= 1.13

## Install

## Usage

To rapidly interact with our API, you can use our `Transactor` helper. It handles all the steps needed to correctly
format, sign and send a tx.

Feel free to explore and modify its code to meet your expectations.

## Examples

Detailed examples are provided in the `examples` folder to explain how to use our `Transactor` helper methods.

You can change various settings in the `examples/common/settings.go` file.

Available examples:
* Send a `Certificate` transaction
* Retrieve a `Certificate` transaction
* Retrieve a list of `Certificate` transactions
* Encrypt and send a `Secret` transaction
* Retrieve a list of `Secret` transactions and try to decrypt them
* Send a `KeyCreate` transaction
* Send a `KeyRevoke` transaction
* Retrieve a list of `Keys` for a company

For instance, to send a certificate:
```bash
go run examples/send_certificate_raw/main.go
```
